# in this file i will practice with python booleans
# first example
a = 200
b = 33

if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
else:
  print("b is not greater than a") 
  # output is b is not greater than a 

# second example
print(bool("Hello"))
print(bool(15))
# output is
     #True
     #True


 #third example
def myFunction() :
  return True

if myFunction():
  print("YES!")
else:
  print("NO!") 
# output is --> YES!

#fourth example
x = 200
print(isinstance(x, int)) 
#outpus is --> True
